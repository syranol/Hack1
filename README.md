# Hack1

Girls In Tech - Hackathon  | During the course of 48 hours, my team and I innovated a breakthrough idea to provide volunteers for community service events hosted by non-profit organization.  I am in charge of the front-end implementation of the website. Functionalities include user sign up, reward page and a search function made possible by the implementation of Google Map's API.
